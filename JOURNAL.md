15th of May

highway was just announced :D

Anyways I was coming up with a few project ideas when suddenly I thought: GUN\
But a gun is boring tbh. It just shoots and does weird stuff.\
So what could be better than a gun you may ask?\
A gun.... ON WHEELS.\
But what could be better than a gun on wheels?\
A REMOTE CONTROL GUN ON WHEELS.

You heard it here first folks. thats how we roll.

Anyways now its time for my suoer cool progress report\
*insert super cool name for the project report*\
I did some cadding today for like an hour or 2 and I made a wheel :D\
I also made some gears and mechanical stuff for the back tires.\
thats about it tbh.
